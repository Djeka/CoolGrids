+ Adams method (2nd order, explicit)
+ several consequent rf-pulses
- where field energy goes to?
- 3rd order hyperbolics
    - write hyperbolic code for orders > 1.5 for advect of vx component
? 3rd order Adams
+ what to do with rf-pulse smoothing, due to hyperbolics
    + insure it is due to hyperbolics: check for long distance with rhs off
    + kurant number equal 1 (didn't help)
    + mmag should more than zero! h/tau should be equal to c

==
- todo
+ done
? need info
